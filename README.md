# Instagram Reach Analysis

## Overview

Instagram Reach Analysis is a project focused on analyzing Instagram reach data over time. The project includes visualizations, statistical analysis, and forecasting to gain insights into reach patterns and trends.

## Project Structure

- `Instagram Reach Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main analysis code.
- `data/`: Folder containing the dataset used for analysis.
- `plots/`: Folder containing visualizations and plots generated during the analysis.
- `README.md`: Project documentation (you're reading it right now).

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
   - Load the Instagram reach dataset.
   - Explore the structure and summary statistics of the data.

2. **Time Series Analysis:**
   - Analyze the time series patterns of Instagram reach.
   - Perform statistical tests such as ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) test for stationarity.

3. **Visualizations:**
   - Create visualizations to illustrate Instagram reach trends.
   - Generate plots for daily, weekly, and monthly reach patterns.

4. **ARIMA Forecasting:**
   - Implement ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for forecasting.
   - Evaluate the accuracy of the forecasting model.

5. **Gallery of Plots:**
   - Display a gallery of plots showcasing different aspects of the Instagram reach analysis.
   - Implement an extreme zoom feature for detailed examination.

## Getting Started
